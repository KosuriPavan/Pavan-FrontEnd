        Want to know who is luffy
        <br>
        open in same tab
        <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Monkey_D._Luffy" style="color: red;">click here</a>
        <!-- Observe when clicked on above link, the page itself redirected to the link and
         opened in the same tab-->
        <!-- Where as in below case, the page opened in new tab. Using <taget="_blank" we can do>-->
        <br>
        open in new tab
        <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Monkey_D._Luffy" style="color:blue;" target="_blank">click here</a>
        <br>
        <!-- well well we redirected to new link which is on internet, what if 
        what if you want to redirected to another html file when clicked.
        To demonstrate it I'm creating new html file named dummy
        here in html we can link those html files as href="./(followed by html file name)"-->
        linking our own made html file
        <a href="./dummy.html">Dummy HTML</a><br>
        <!-- nice nice, now If you had observed in some websites when clicked on hyperlinks 
        it will not open new page, unless it redirects to some part of the own parent page.
        Like if you observed on education pages, there will be bullet points like
        Introduction
        Chapter 1
        Chapter 2 etc
        but when clicked on any of the link the page will automatically scrolls down to the 
        introduction matter 
        do you remember those pages?
        now we are doing exactly the same
        This means the previous links are external pages hence we call them 
        external referencing/linking
        But now we are doing internal referencing/linking
        To understand better i will use this dummy html file we created and add theory matter-->
        For understanding internal referencing click below and click on chapter 3<br>
        <a href="./dummy.html" target="_blank">Dummy HTML</a><br>
        <!-- go to dummy html file to see internal referencing code-->

        <!-- now we see many websites where we click on image and it redirects
        just as wee spoke we can add any css tags inside then add img tag-->

    <!-- lets learn div and span tags-->
    Below are differences between div and span tags<br>
    <!-- div tag usually occupies whole line thats means here below eventhough the matter
        is small the styling is applied to whole line -->
    <div style="background-color: yellow;"> div1 </div>
    <div style="background-color: blue;"> div2 </div>
    <div style="background-color: brown;"> div3 </div>
    <br>
    <!-- whereas span takes only the space of the matter for styling -->
    <span style="background-color: yellow;"> span1 </span>
    <span style="background-color: blue;"> span2 </span>
    <span style="background-color: brown;"> span3 </span>
    <!-- there are some limitations to span tag. for suppose if we given height styling to div tag
        the background color will have the height we mention whereas span can't do that 
        height width of styling can't be done in span tag
        below is example -->
    <br><br>
    <div style="background-color: blue; height: 200px; width: 200px;"> div tag with heigth styling bg</div><br>
    <span style="background-color: red; height: 200px; width: 200px;"> span tag with same as height styling tag</span>
    <!-- observed diff ! span neither takes height neither takes width -->>
