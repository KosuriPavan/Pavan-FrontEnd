<p>1.1 Internet of Things
The Internet of Things (IoTs) can be described as connecting everyday objects like smartphones, Internet TVs, sensors and actuators to the Internet where the devices are
intelligently linked together enabling new forms of communication between things and
people, and between things themselves. Building IoTs has advanced significantly in the
last couple of years since it has added a new dimension to the world of information and
communication technologies. According to [1], it is expected that the number of devices
connected to the Internet will accumulate from 100.4 million in 2011 to 2.1 billion by the
year 2021, growing at a rate of 36% per year. In the year 2011, 80% machine to machine
(M2M) connections were made over mobile networks such as 2G and 3G and it is predicted
that by 2021, this ratio will increase to 93% since the cost related with M2M over mobile
networks are generally cheaper than fixed networks as illustrated in Figure 1.1 [1].

Now anyone, from anytime and anywhere can have connectivity for anything and it is
expected that these connections will extend and create an entirely advanced dynamic
network of IoTs. The development of the Internet of Things will revolutionize a number of
sectors, from automation, transportation, energy, healthcare, financial services to
nanotechnology.
1.2 Home Automation Systems
IoTs technology can also be applied to create a new concept and wide development space
for smart homes to provide intelligence, comfort and to improve the quality of life. Thus,
home automation becomes much more popular nowadays. In 1984, the National
Association of Home Builders (NAHB) introduced the “smart house” concept. The
researches and developments in this field continued over the years, but to actually automate
a building is still a quite expensive job. This leads to the question: “If it is expensive, why
home automation?”. First, home automation brings interoperability: the temperature can
be set to a certain value according to certain conditions, lighting can be turned on, off or
may be dimmed based on daylight. Second, home automation implies remote access, such
as monitoring the house using a laptop or even the own cell phone. Third, a smart home
automation system should have the possibility to be extended or reduced when needed.
Therefore, it can bring expandability and also energy savings. Nowadays, one of the hottest
topics in media is related to energy conservation. Automation systems can help the energy
savings by, for example, turning off the electronic devices automatically when they are not
in use. A house which is equipped with such a system offers much more comfort,
flexibility, elegance, security, but most important, reduced maintenance costs through the
3
optimization of the consumption of electricity and heat. For example, some of these smart
houses can include simple things like turning the sprinkler at some time during the day or
detecting thieves in the middle of the night; others are more advanced and employ sensors
for detecting the presence of a person in a room, used to adjust the ambient light, to control
the temperature or the music volume depending on various factors. A field which
encompasses all facilities of a smart home is “domotic”. The domotic term was coined in
1984 by the journalist Bruno de Latour. It is a combination of technologies and services
that improve the life in the areas of safety, comfort and technical management, resulting in
a complete system. Things can happen automatically, as they are necessary or as they are
scheduled by the users. However, the user does not lose the control over the house, manual
operation being available also. Typically, domotic systems need to collect data from
various sensors and make things such as light and temperature to automatically adjust.
Moreover, using these sensors, many tasks can be accomplished, such as, controlling
curtains and windows without human intervention, opening, locking or unlocking the
garage gate, controlling the climate inside the house, providing the corresponding light in
each room, starting
the sprinkler when the soil is too dry and so on. However, the concept of home automation
gets increasingly louder on the market, being a relatively new concept which draws
attention to researchers. This leads to new technologies that can perform home automation
functions.
Different devices and the appliances in the home such as lightings, air condition, home
security and entertainment systems are now being connected to the Internet so that it can
be controlled remotely using the Smartphones or Tablets. Not only devices can be
4
controlled, but home environment can also be continuously monitored for maintaining
certain desired temperature or monitoring amount of energy consumption. Hence, this will
contribute to overall cost reduction and energy saving which is one of the main concerns
of today.
This paper presents a low cost and flexible home control and monitoring system using a
Raspberry Pi, with IP connectivity for accessing and controlling devices and appliances
using Apple Home app and an Android based smartphone app. The proposed system does
not require a dedicated server PC with respect to similar systems and offers a flexible and
low cost medium to monitor and control the home environment. The device utilizes control
functionality of home appliances also through web browsers as an additional medium of
access apart from iOS and Android based smartphones.
The IoT includes everything from wearable fitness bands and smart home appliances to
factory control devices, medical devices and even automobiles. Security has not been a
high priority for these devices until now. There has been a lot of discussion regarding the
hacking of devices and systems to obtain information and data. However, just as critical
are cyber-attacks against the devices themselves - attacks which take over control of the
device and cause them to operate in dangerous and insecure ways.
Unfortunately, many of these systems – thought to be safe – are still vulnerable. For
instance, even though Industrial Automation and Critical Infrastructure devices are usually
installed inside the secure perimeter of an enterprise network, that perimeter is porous and
can be easily penetrated or disabled. On top of that, insider threats, whether malicious or
accidental, make up 70% of cyber-attacks, and they usually originate inside that perimeter.
It is necessary to secure the Things themselves. Security challenges in IoT include privacy,
5
authentication and secure end-to-end connection. In addition, with the presence of multiple
smart home standards currently used in the market, any security scheme needs to consider
inter-compatibility among the multiple standards.
Figure 1.2 - The System Setup
Figure 1.2 shows the setup of the proposed system, consisting of several IoT devices
connected via the Home Wi-Fi network. The users can access and control the system using
a mobile device by accessing the home Wi-Fi. The network is responsible for
authenticating and monitoring the communication between devices in the system.
Each IoT device can only communicate with the home network. Based on user preferences,
the information from one device can also trigger the network to send a message to another
device in order to response with appropriate action.

<h1 id="chapter2">CHAPTER 2 : RELATED WORK</h1><br>
<p>Home automation or Smart Homes (also known as domotic) can be described as
introduction of technology within the home environment to provide convenience, comfort,
security and energy efficiency to its occupant. Adding intelligence to home environment
can provide increased quality of life for the elderly and disabled people who might
otherwise require caregivers or institutional care. There has been a significant increase in
home automation in recent years due to higher affordability and advancement in Smart
phones and tablets which allows vast connectivity. With the introduction of the Internet of
Things, the research and implementation of home automation are getting more popular.
Much of the research attention has been given in academia. Various wireless technologies
that can support some form of remote data transfer, sensing and control such as Bluetooth,
Wi-Fi, RFID, and cellular networks have been utilized to embed various levels of
intelligence in the home. The studies have presented Bluetooth based home automation
systems using Android Smart phones without the Internet controllability. The devices are
physically connected to a Bluetooth sub-controller which is then accessed and controlled
by the Smart phone using built-in Bluetooth connectivity. However, due to limited range
of operation (maximum up to 100 m) the system is unable to cope with mobility and can
only be controlled within the vicinity. Researchers have also attempted to provide network
interoperability and remote access to control devices and appliances at home using home
gateways. Researches introduced a Wi-Fi based home control system using PC based web
server which manages the connected home devices. Similar designs have also been
presented in where a dedicated web server, database and a web page have been developed
8
to interconnect and manage the devices with the Internet. The disadvantages of these
systems are twofold. Firstly, a high end personal computer has been utilized which not only
increases the cost of installation but also increases the energy consumption. Secondly,
development and hosting of web pages which also add to the cost. A GSM based
communication and control for home appliances has also been presented where different
AT commands are sent to the Home Mobile for controlling different appliances. The
drawback of this system is that users are not provided with a graphical user interface and
users have to remember different AT commands to control the connected devices.
Researches proposed mobile IP based architecture and its potential applications in Smart
homes security and automation without any actual deployment and testing. Lately few
researchers have also presented use of Web services, Simple Object Access Protocol
(SOAP) and Representational State Transfer (REST) as an interoperable application layer
to remotely access home automation systems. Researches introduced a smart home
management scheme over the Ethernet network based on XML SOAP standards. The
drawback of using SOAP based Web a service is that it is complex and adds overhead to
the client and server when parsing the message, resulting in slower operation and higher
Bandwidth. REST has been presented as a Web-based interaction for controlling household
appliances using Web techniques such as HTTP caching and push messaging. Also, a Webbased graphical user interface has been developed to manage the home devices. Home
automation using Cloud computing has also been proposed where users were able to
control various lights and appliances within their home. The above-mentioned systems
have made significant contributions to the design and development of home automation
systems. However, the existing works were mainly focused on developing a single type of
9
accessing functionality for their home automation devices rather than combining different
kinds of ways through which the device can be accessed and controlled depending upon
the different kinds of mobile devices users in the same household may own.

<h1 id="chapter3">CHAPTER 3 : MOTIVATING EXAMPLES</h1>><br>
<p>I was motivated to pursue this project due to numerous reasons. Although automation is
not a new idea in our modern life. Large businesses and wealthy homeowners have already
implemented this technology for years now. With this project, I wanted to see this concept
getting more accessible to very home owner, due to cheaper cost, easier to setup and used
modular concept and also higher internet penetration rate. The system needs to be simple
enough to be used by one and all. With this project, I hoped that it will provide a better
quality of life, while reducing the electricity wastage by giving user the power to control,
conserve and react according to user needs.
On researching, I found several similar projects that motivated me further. [2] describes a
system that provides a wireless remote-control solution for controlling the lights and fan
via Wi-Fi capable handheld devices such as Smartphone, adding convenience and also
reducing electricity wastage. While this concept is not new, all of this only appeals to tech
savvy user, due to the complexity, feature and price, which are not important for
this project target user. In this project, appliances such as light and fan that connected to
the Main Control Unit (MCU) still can be controlled remotely from a computer screen or
a smart phone. This is performed by using a very simplistic Graphical User Interface
(Graphical User Interface, GUI), which is easily used and understandable for the target
user. This system can also be equipped with the monitoring function by including a web
camera to the MCU for a live video feed, or from wearable electronics wore by the user
which for example include heartbeat sensor.

[5] presents a low cost secure cell phone based, flexible home automation system.
Appliances at home are connected to the Arduino BT board. The communication between
the cell phone and the Arduino BT board is wireless. Additional devices can be connected
into the system with little modifications. Since the cell phone script is written in Python, it
is portable and can run on any Symbian Operating System platform. The system is secured
for access from any user or intruder. The users are expected to acquire pairing password
for the Arduino BT and the cell phone to access the home appliances. This adds a protection
from unauthorized users. This system can be used as a test bed for any appliances that
requires on-off switching applications without any internet connection.
[24] project integrates locally and remotely controlled systems with the use of Cloud data
network. This allows the system to operate without the dependence of a mobile provider,
allows the system to be used with various mobile phone platforms, and allows the system
to operate locally when phone or computer access is not available. Cloud networking and
data infrastructure allow individuals to monitor, manage, and control their personal data
points through the Internet. Each data stream is given a unique feed identification number
to differentiate itself from all other data Streams on the Network. The home control is
achieved via a hand held remote which uses Zigbee wireless communication to the home
controller which is integrated with the cloud network via an internet connection.
[13] put forwards the design of home automation and security system using Android ADK.
The design is based on a standalone embedded system board Android ADK(Accessory
Development Kit) at home. Home appliances are connected to the ADK and
communication is established between the ADK and Android mobile device or tablet. The
12
home appliances are connected to the input/output ports of the embedded system board and
their status is passed to the ADK. It presents an authentication to the system for authorized
person to access home appliances. The device with low cost and scalable to less
modification to the core is much important. It presents the design and implementation of
automation system that can monitor and control home appliances via android phone or
tablet.
Although all these projects motivated me to pursue my idea, I still felt need for a better
design and implementation. I wanted to design a home automation system which had all
the specifications of above mentioned projects like low cost, ease of use, low energy
consumption but I wanted the user experience to be similar for all kinds of device users.
Hence, I pursued the idea of a device that has three ways of communicating with home
appliances. First is through Apple Home app, which runs on iOS 10 or later, and lets you
securely control smart home devices or any home appliance as long as the device is added
in the Apple HomeKit as an accessory. The second way is through the means of an Android
app. And lastly, the application is not only limited to smartphones but also can be used by
feature phones through web browser. </p>
